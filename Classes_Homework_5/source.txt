An ‘Out Station Connection’ field should be created identifying if there is a connection at the Out Station. The formula used to identify this is as follows:
If Flight’s departure airport is identified as ‘Out Station' (REQ_ 016) and Con From does not equal NULL
OR If Flight’s arrival airport is identified as ‘Out Station’ (REQ_ 016) and Con To does not equal NULL
then “Y”.
