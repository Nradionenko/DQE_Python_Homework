In general, it is best if empty values (“,,”) are provided if and only if the value of a field is unknown. The value can be unknown due to an error in a 3rd party system, or due to an operator forgetting to enter it, due to the system just not sending this value for whatever reason, etc. Note that in the case that the value is known and is 0, then 0 should be explicitly written in the CSV file, even when it is known that “it is always 0”. For example:
•	If an airline never flies first class, then PAX_F should always contain 0 and not an empty string (because the airline knows they never fly first class, hence there are always 0 first class passengers onboard);
•	If the PAX split by gender PAX_MALE / PAX_FEMALE / PAX_CHILDREN / PAX_INFANT is available from some stations but not from others, then sometimes e.g. PAX_MALE should contain regular number, and sometimes an empty value (“,,”). The latter case should happen only when the PAX_MALE value is indeed unknown, i.e. the PAX record arrives from a station that does not provide splitting of PAX figures by gender (i.e. this split is unknown for this station).
