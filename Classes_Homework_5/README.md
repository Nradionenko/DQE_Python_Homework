1. PyInputPlus module needs to be installed to run this app: https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/
2. Target file name, as well as all messages and a lot of other stuff is configured in configs.ini file. The file needs to be kept in the same directory as configloader module.
3. Target file will be stored in the current working directory where package is executed.
4. To execute the script one can run the Classes_Homework5 directory in cmd: __main__.py should be picked up by default.
5. No specific text input validation is implemented except for input length. I would also add some validation for accepted characters so that file encoding doesn't fail at the end if user inputs cyrillyc etc, 
but i didn't add it) But i can)
