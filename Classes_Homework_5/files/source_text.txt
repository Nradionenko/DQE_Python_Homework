sectionText: Thinly slice the spring onions, reserving a handful of the sliced green parts for garnish.
Peel and chop the garlic. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and cook the spring onions and garlic for a few minutes.
Add the tomatoes, curry powder and ground ginger and cook for 3-4 minutes.
If the pan gets dry add a splash of water and make sure the spices don't burn.
